### 3. Application Help

To mark a column as a column for completed tasks, the user needs to check
a box. We provide a help text that can be revealed by hovering a question mark
to tell the user the function of the checkbox.

### 4. Input validation

On the server side, we used the laravel Request validate method. On the client side,
validation is made using HTML forms.

Example of validation of the creation of a task:

On the server side:

```php
$request->validate([
        'name' => 'required',
        'description' => 'nullable',
        'due_date' => 'nullable|date|after_or_equal:tomorrow'
      ]);
```

On the client side:

```html
<input class="form-control" type="text" name="name" value="{{ $task->name }}" required/>
<input class="form-control" type="date" name="due_date" value="{{ $task->due_date }}" pattern="\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}">
```
